    "Now that you have built a dataframe of the postal code of each neighborhood along with the borough name and neighborhood name, in order to utilize the Foursquare location data, we need to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an older version of this course, we were leveraging the Google Maps Geocoding API to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood. However, recently Google started charging for their API: http://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/, so we will use the Geocoder Python package instead: https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this Package is you have to be persistent sometimes in order to get the geographical coordinates of a given postal code. So you can make a call to get the latitude and longitude coordinates of a given postal code and the result would be None, and then make the call again and you would get the coordinates. So, in order to make sure that you get the coordinates for all of our neighborhoods, you can run a while loop for each postal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this package can be very unreliable, in case you are not able to get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods using the Geocoder package, here is a link to a csv file that has the geographical coordinates of each postal code: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Note: There is a limit on how many times you can call geocoder.google function. It is 2500 times per day. This should be way more than enough for you to get acquainted with the package and to use it to get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods in the Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are able to create the above dataframe, submit a link to the new Notebook on your Github repository."
